TODO -

Strings - 
- check for valid input for plane code - only capital letters allowed
- in address of an airplane input - if there is more than one word in a term, and if there is a word in that term that has even letters, then transform 
the letter to have first capital second lower and repeat. example: Israel@Tel#AvIv@Ben#GuRiOn@9


Memory - 
- make init functions for:
	AirportManager V
	Flight//*
	Airport//*
	Airplane//*
	Date//*
	Airline V
- after init functions are made, can make free for each 

General - 
- source.c is only main functions, every function that in the switch-case should be in functionsLib
- check why flight is 28 bytes
- minimize Airline
- const pointers on functions that do not change the pointer's value

# notes
- we might assume a number input is a number. but should verify if it is within the required limits
